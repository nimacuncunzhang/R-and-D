- R & D project experience should help you get an IT role.

  - the ability for continuous learning- self-learning and learning on the fly
  - new skills and knowledge: technical skills, frameworks, tools and technology, WBS [processes & practices], project management,  team work (task sharing), communication and interaction, negotiation skills.
  - agility/flexibility
  - emotional maturity and feel confident to apply for IT jobs
  - use the R & D experience (specific examples from above) to answer interview questions (have reality or facts)

## Note taking language & software learning

**Reasons for choosing markdown**
After investigating the existing note taking software in the market I decided to use markdown as my main note taking software in the future. This is because markdown is more cost effective than other note taking languages. It takes less time to learn the code than more specialized languages, and more freedom than journaling tools that do not require programming. Not only that, it is a cross-platform universal language that works well on mac, windows, linux, and even mobile platforms. At the same time, markdown can be displayed on html browsers. On the other hand, the high level of market adoption has led to many and comprehensive tutorials, which will make my learning more efficient.

**Markdown supports** [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/api.html) **or** [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) **to render mathematical expressions**

**code:**

\$\$
\begin{Bmatrix}
   a & b \\\\
   c & d
\end{Bmatrix}
\$\$
\$\$
\begin{CD}
   A @>a>> B \\\\
@VbVV @AAcA \\\\
   C @= D
\end{CD}
\$\$


**effect：**

$$
\begin{Bmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
\end{Bmatrix}
$$
$$
\begin{CD}
   A @>a>> B \\
@VbVV @AAcA \\
   C @= D
\end{CD}
$$



**At the same time markdown also supports**  [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) **for rendering**
**code：**

\```mermaid

    A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
    B --> C{Let me think}
    C -->|One| D[Laptop]
    C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
